# Cappuccino - xamarin-forms branch
![](/Images/logo.png)


My attempt to do "quick research" of Capuccino iOS Xamarin /Monodroid project
(and, maybe, to assemble some veery lite and small VK client... idk yet!).
Experimental software (16299-15063 metamorph.). No auth page at now.

## My 2 cents
- I added "empty" UWP project into solution
- Xamarin Forms, not MAUI

## About my fork
- UWP (16299) & .NET Standard 2.0
- Special W10M 15063+ compatibility 

## Reference

As is. No support. RnD only.
